## Acknowledgments

This project was created to help English learners efficiently manage their vocabulary learning journey.

Preparing for TOEFL and GRE, I was overwhelmed by vocabulary. I needed a way to save and review words quickly. While reading English articles, I wanted a faster method to look up and track words without switching apps. So, I designed this application to list and save words instantly.
