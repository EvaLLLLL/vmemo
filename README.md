## Test

Since the word-tracking features are currently for personal use only, registration is not available. If you’d like to access all features, you can use the test account provided below.

However, you can still use the reading and dictionary features without logging in. I hope this offers you some help!

## Why

While preparing for my TOEFL and GRE exams, I was often overwhelmed by the massive volume of vocabulary. I needed a way to quickly save the words I looked up and review them efficiently. Moreover, when reading English articles, I wanted a faster method to look up words and track the ones I had checked, eliminating the need to waste time switching between apps. That’s why I designed this simple application, where you can list the words you’ve looked up on the right side while reading and save them instantly after checking.
